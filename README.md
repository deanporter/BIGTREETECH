These are the files you need to configure Marlin 2.1.2.0 for the BIGTREETECH SKR-mini-E3 V2 and the TFT35 E3 V3.0 Touch Screen for the Ender 3 Pro<br>
<br>
Instructions: <br>
1) Download or Clone the Marlin 2.1.2.0 branch from here --> https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/2.1.x

Notes on this configuration:<br>
The Extruder and Z-axis stepper motors are 90ยบ stepper motors with the voltages adjusted for these motors.<br>
I have a Keenovo AC silicone mats for the bed heater and the Bed Thermistor is set to 11 for this. <br>
I have a CR-Touch probe and have this configured along with Unified Bed Leveling (UBL).<br>
I started this with the default Marlin config and added the changes recommended by Big Tree Tech (BTT) for the Mini E3 V2 and the TFT35 V3 touchscreen.<br>
I have also made numerous tweaks to this over time (and versions).<br>
